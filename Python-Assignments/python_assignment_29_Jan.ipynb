    "### 5. is python code compiled or interpreted ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code is typically interpreted. When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line without prior compilation into machine code. However, Python does perform a compilation step internally. It compiles the source code into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation that the interpreter can execute. This compilation step happens automatically and transparently to the user. Therefore, Python is often referred to as an interpreted language due to its dynamic and interactive nature."

    "2. Run the Installer: Double-click the downloaded installer to run it. Check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\" during the installation process. This will automatically set the necessary environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Customize Installation (Optional): You can customize the installation location and features by clicking on the \"Customize installation\" button. However, it's generally recommended to proceed with the default settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Complete the Installation: Follow the instructions provided by the installer and complete the installation process. Python will be installed on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verify the Installation: Open the command prompt or PowerShell and enter the following command: python --version. This command will display the installed Python version if the installation was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Set PATH Variables (If Not Set Automatically): In some cases, the PATH variables may not be set automatically. To set them manually, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Open the Start menu and search for \"Environment Variables\" and select \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n",
    " - In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    " - In the \"System variables\" section, scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable. Select it and click the \"Edit\" button.\n",
    " - Click the \"New\" button and enter the path to the Python installation directory. By default, it is \"C:\\PythonXX\" (where XX represents the version number).\n",
    " - Click \"OK\" to save the changes and close all the windows.\n",
    "7. Verify Path Variables. If the Python version is displayed, the path variables are set correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can install Python on Windows and ensure that the necessary path variables are set, allowing you to run Python from any location in the command prompt or PowerShell."
